Hello, Thanks for stopping by!

I want to use this time to relearn HTML and CSS because there seems to be gaps within my knowledge.

These past fews days, I actually had the time to sit down and learn the basics to which I can based my
knowledge upon. 

Here are some of the things that I have learned so far before I start on my first project!

Linux: 
-ssh commands
-Accessing and creating new files
-How to move and sort through the different directories

Git:
-Setting up encryptions - OAuth
-Learning the basics of the loading and commits
-Push & fetch
-Checking status
-Overall the usefulness of it all

HTML and CSS:
-Initialization of HTML file
-Classes, heading, paragraphs, and breaks
-Basic CSS styling
-Images and Videos and how to adjust its sizing

These are fairly simple, yet are core to learning its fundamentals. 

Thanks again!
